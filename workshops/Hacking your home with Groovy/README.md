## Description

Using the [SmartThings](http://www.smartthings.com) platform, you can now put your groovy skills to use by controlling your lights, locks, garage doors, and thermostats. This session will focus on writing SmartApps, which are small groovy programs that are used to control your home.

## Workshop Prerequisites:

* You should have a basic understanding of groovy syntax
* Please bring a computer to participate in the coding exercises.

## Before the conference:

If you want to get a head start, you can [download the ST mobile app](http://www.smartthings.com/product/) for Android, iOS, or Windows. You can sign up for a free account and set up a location. When you get to the point of entering a welcome code, you'll have to stop, unless you actually have a SmartThings hub.

You can also check out what is happening in the community by going to [community.smartthings.com](http://community.smartthings.com).

And if you are really ambitious, you can look at some of the introductory material at [docs.smartthings.com](http://docs.smartthings.com).
