## Description
Grails is a complete web application framework that runs on the Java JVM. It 
provides a full-stack framework, and handles all layers from the user interface 
to the persistence layer. Grails is based on known and proven technologies, such 
as the Spring Framework and Hibernate.

This workshop aims to show how to get from 0 to running application with Grails 
in three hours. We will touch the following points:

* Grails application structure 
* Domain model and persistence 
* Controllers 
* Services 
* Testing
* User Interface



## Workshop Prerequisites:

* You should bring your own laptop.
* The workshop is designed for people who have at least some Java coding experience.
* Groovy coding experience would help a lot. 
* If you don't have experience with Groovy, consider attending the Java to Groovy workshop earlier in the day.


## Before the Conference

If you can, install the following:

* Java 7 or 8
* Grails 3.0.3
* (Optional) install GVM from gvmtool.net
