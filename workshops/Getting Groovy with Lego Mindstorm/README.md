## Description

Using the Lego Mindstorms EV3 and [leJos](http://http://www.lejos.org/) platform and Groovy, you can learn to use Groovy on an embedded device and have some fun doing it too! We will learn a little about the leJos API and how Groovy works on it. Then we'll have some fun hack time with robots pushing your groovy code to them and see what you can do. We'll also cover and use a Grails3 App called WebRover that will simulate a mars rover that we can control via your PC web browser, mobile, or Android Wear device. Finally we'll wrap up with some Android Wear + EV3 fun driving the robots around some more.

## Workshop Prerequisites:

* You should have a basic understanding of groovy syntax
* Please bring a computer to participate in the coding exercises.
* Try to bring a smartphone with either iOS app installed called 'WebOfCam' or an Android Device with 'IP Webcam' installed. If you have a Android Wear watch, bring it, you can drive your (loaner) robot around with it too!
## Before the conference:

Install the following software:
* JDK 1.7 or higher
* GVM Tool
* Groovy 2.4.x
* Grails 3.0.1
* Grails 2.2.5 (If you don't want Grails3)
* Gradle 2.3

Optional to play with the Android-Wear stuff:
